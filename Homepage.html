       <p> My family is doing everything it can to see me prosper.There were times i feel like this is not going to work or probably i'm just wasting my time and in return my wife would tell me, hey this is just the begining of what God has in stock for you do not give up just yet </p>
       <p> The truth is, it has really not been easy for me and my family especially with my low income and a child we need to take care of you know. I all even if i have a thousand reasons to quit, my family's well being is my one reason i can't quit. so we here digging and trusting in the Lord for retentive memory because the truth is, coding is not easy i must confess. only smart people can code. </p>
       <p> There is also this beautiful young Angel in the picture snd her name is Miranda ikhide Maxwell Ohiorenoya, who inspires me to keep pushing that i' just at the verge of breakthrough. </p>
       <p> To to the one who gives us reasons to dream and dream big in the first place, JESUS CHRIST i say thank you because you alone makes all of this possible and still making it possible. i will forever be grateful as long as i draw breadth.</p>
